# Multi-VLAN-Router-on-a-Stick

This project demonstrates a multi-VLAN network design using Cisco Catalyst switches and a Cisco 2901 router configured for inter-VLAN routing using 802.1Q router-on-a-stick. The topology segments three departments into isolated VLANs and uses subinterfaces on the router to allow controlled inter-VLAN communication.

# Objectives

Create multiple VLANs for network segmentation

Assign switchports to appropriate VLANs

Configure 802.1Q trunking between switches and router

Implement router-on-a-stick using subinterfaces

Verify connectivity using ping and show commands

Troubleshoot trunking and VLAN membership issues
